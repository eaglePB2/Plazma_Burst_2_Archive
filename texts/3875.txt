Plazma Burst 2 multiplayer has been updated multiple times through its&apos; existence. Specifically,these updates concern hit detection. Additionally, it is important to note that having low network latency (ping) will reduce many of the differences between the two available network code modes:Initially, whether a player was hit by another player depended on the player being hit - this was referred to as the "Old Netcode (Classic)" network mode.Over time, a mode emerged where hit detection was shifted to the player causing the damage â€“ this is the "New Netcode."Each network code has its own characteristics:Classic Netcode :- Your accuracy depends on correctly predicting the non-AI enemy positions under network latency. Sometimes, if not predicted correctly, your shots may not cause damage.- You can easily dodge enemy bullets in your game.- Your bullets may have different trajectories in the enemy&apos;s view due to network latency.- Typically used as the PB2 official tournament mode.- Many community custom maps are designed in this mode due to its early release and long runtime.New Netcode:- You don&apos;t need to predict enemy positions; hitting enemies in your game causes damage.- The time it takes for your shots to damage enemies is also affected by network latency.- If enemies see your nearest position due to network latency, you might be hit - you could be damaged or killed without seeing the source.- It may be more suitable for PVE multiplayer games.
