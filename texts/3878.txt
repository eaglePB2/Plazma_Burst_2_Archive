Classic Mode - In the Classic Mode, the game settings allow the use of maps with "low" physics settings to reduce fall damage and speed up Selfboost. Over time, many players in the PB2 community have specially crafted maps based on this mode in categories like saw/self-boost/traps/escape.If you are unsure about which option to choose, we generally recommend sticking with the default setting - Classic Physics - as most maps and gameplay are designed around this mode.New Physics Mode - In this mode, all players will be forced to use "High Physics."Note: The "low" physics setting in the game settings can produce abnormal effects due to improper physics engine optimization (it may even be a unique gameplay feature of PB2 itself). It does not decrease the simulation rate but incorrectly adds velocity to positions. It has been decided to retain this feature in Plazma Burst 2. Its effects also depend on frame rate.
